I'm a passionate web developer focused on building clean, accessible, and responsive websites and applications. I specialize in **JavaScript**, **React**, and modern frontend technologies, with experience bringing real-world projects to life from concept to deployment.

I’m also committed to continuous learning and enjoy working on meaningful projects that make a difference — whether it's a **personal learning tracker**, **interactive websites**, or storytelling through **code and design**.
